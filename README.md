# Project 3: Around The U.S.
  
**Intro**
  
This project deals with responsive web design, focusing on 1280px screen size and 320px screen size. It is my first responsive web design project and my first time using Figma as a project brief. 
  
**Figma**

**Images**  
  
The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster. 
  
Good luck and have fun!
